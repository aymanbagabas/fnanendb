{"title":"Sway","lyrics":"When marimba rhythms start to play\n\nDance with me, make me sway\n\nLike a lazy ocean hugs the shore\n\nHold me close, sway me more\nLike a flower bending in the breeze\n\nBend with me, sway with ease\n\nWhen we dance you have a way with me\n\nStay with me, sway with me\nOther dancers may be on the floor\n\nDear, but my eyes will see only you\n\nOnly you have that magic technique\n\nWhen we sway I go weak\nI can hear the sounds of violins\n\nLong before it begins\n\nMake me thrill as only you know how\n\nSway me smooth, sway me now\n\n \n\n\nاستمع إلى \"Sway\" على أنغامي","url":"https://fnanen.com/klmat/alaghany/h-/hyfa2-ohby/sway.html?arabic=Sway"}
