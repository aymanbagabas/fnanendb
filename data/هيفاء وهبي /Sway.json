{"title":"Sway","lyrics":"When marimba rhythms start to play\nDance with me, make me sway\nLike a lazy ocean hugs the shore\nHold me close, sway me more\nLike a flower bending in the breeze\nBend with me, sway with ease\nWhen we dance you have a way with me\nStay with me, sway with me\nOther dancers may be on the floor\nDear, but my eyes will see only you\nOnly you have that magic technique\nWhen we sway I go weak\nI can hear the sounds of violins\nLong before it begins\nMake me thrill as only you know how\nSway me smooth, sway me now","url":"https://fnanen.com/klmat/alaghany/h-/hyfa2-ohby/sway.html?arabic=Sway"}
