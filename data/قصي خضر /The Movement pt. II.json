{"title":"The Movement pt. II","date":"2010","lyrics":"I’ve been living around here for years\nBut some individual still trying to interfere\nMy movement … Cuz they’re ignorant\nBut I will teach them some wisdom mixed with common sense so this\nGoes out to residents … Trying to block my references\nVacate the premises … Your knowledge is limited\nJust check my evidence … Never served no burgerses\nI drop the emphasis … To the ones who’s listening\nLegend like the Pegasus … Soul Hop the nemesis\nSpit like I’m venomous … Judge me cuz I’m Arabic\nLoad, clip, affirmative … Revolutionist, Activist\nFreedom, we’re searching it … Music conservative\nTest my constitious … Real I’m still keeping it\nProfit of righteousness … You sound ridiculous\nMy peoples like … What is this? Witness the turbulence\nTake notes, experience … 10 men can’t handle it\nSo damn addictive … Loving it or killing it\nPositive or negative … I don’t care if you’re sick of this\nElevate, don’t miss … To the presidents too\nCuz in the end, I’m a human … Just like you!","url":"https://fnanen.com/klmat/alaghany/8/89y/the-movement-pt--ii.html?arabic=The%20Movement%20pt.%20II"}
