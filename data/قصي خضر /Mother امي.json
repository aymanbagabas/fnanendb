{"title":"Mother امي","lyrics":"This is it…it should have been done long time ago\nWhen our mothers never been appreciated before\nThe wait is over…they’ve been providing their shoulders\nFor us to cry on…for us to hold on\nStay strong…has been their word since birth\nThe land that we live on we call it mother earth\nSo can you explain the 9 months of pain?\nCarrying a life secured with love throughout her veins\nThe first kiss and touch with a smile on her face\nThe first tear of joy that can’t be replaced\nThe first hand to feed you from her wounds and breast\nThe first hug that makes you able to witness Gods bless\nThe first teacher to guide you with knowledge and discipline\nThe first angel to deliver heaven sent\nNow if you lose her in your life…you’ll see nothing but suffer\nBottom line is I can’t live without my mother\nChorus (English):\nTo all the mothers all across the world\nI wanna shower you with diamonds and pearls\nThere ain’t nobody that can do what you do my mama\nDedicated to the ladies, girls, women, sister, princesses, queens, and goddesses\nTo all the mothers all across the world…we love you…place no one above you\nVerse 2:\nDear mama I apologize for all the things I’ve put you through\nI know I’ve been a bad boy lost without a clue\nBut because of you and prayers I’ve been found\nYour advice and guidance made me turn my life around\nRaised me well…taught me right from wrong\nHow to treat women with respect…so this song is a gift from your sons and daughter\nCan’t compare to all you offerings, what you gave, and shared\nSingle mothers out there…keep your head up\nNo matter how hard it is…you’ll never fed up\nIt’s time for you to rest now…I thank you\nYou’ve done more than enough…so let comfort you\nYou are my heart and soul to any kind of weather\nMy #1 queen…I will cherish you forever\nThere’s a door in paradise just for you\nI leave you with these simple words…I LOVE YOU!\nملكة روحي انتي ..أميرة عمري انتي\nفي حياتي مافي زيك يا أمي..أمي\nانتي في الدنيا الأهم... انتي الحقيقه والحلم\nربي يرعاكي مالي غير رضاكي انتي يا أمي...أمي","url":"https://fnanen.com/klmat/alaghany/8/89y/mother-amy.html?arabic=Mother%20%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A"}
