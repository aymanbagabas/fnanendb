{"title":"JL Anthem","date":"2010","lyrics":"In the name of music, let me start this rhyme that’s divine\nAs I enter your mind so I can show you the sign\nPlus define one time cuz my point will shine whether it’s yours or mine\nAnd that’s the bottom line\nIt’s the quiet riot that’s taking over this earth\nUniversal Language ever since the birth of the art\nAppreciation is must so you know in God we trust\nBest believe it’s the JL Anthem\nExtra Ordinary Gentlemen and we’re handsome\nOne fist hard working generation\nCuz success is a journey, not a destination\nWithout a reasonable doubt I call it rendezvous\nMy Eyesomnia like it’s a Dejavu\nThe only thing that keeps us together\nFor better or worst I will cherish it forever\nWe came a long way and we ain’t gonna stop\nCuz we gonna do what we love to do\nNo matter what you people say about us\nWe still got nothing but love for you\nCuz you know we don’t care about you\nThis song is dedicated to those who just don’t know how to act\nIf you don’t like the song turn it off or turn the volume down\nWe still gonna kill you with our sound\nWelcome to the Soul-Hop Movement\nExperimental edutainment coming through from an underground basement\nImmortal with techniques that’s unique\nEmphasize the lyrics that blends with the beat\nTo the rest we’re simply the best I thought I told you so\nYou shouldn’t hold that against me though\nIt’s a gift but considered a curse and it hurts\nLet me express what’s it worth\n\n\n\nI was a music fan\nTill I became a man\nNow we just wanna live\nTill the day that we die\nJust to get by\nIt’s like a jack of all trades plays the part of the joker\nUps and down the life of a stock broker\nI got my heart ribbon in my hand as a witness\nI use it for pleasure and business\nI am Hip Hop, the Elements, and the Art\nThe Culture, the Business, the End, and the Start\nThe Revolution and the Action\nThe voice of the generation to disregard the reaction\nNow I ma hypnotize you like a drug so take this\nFollow the leader and learn the basics\nGet in the matrix and check the latest\nCuz I studied the greats and became the greatest\nSo overstand the politics\nWe in it for the victorious like Notorious out to get the trophy that’s so glorious\nMore like the infamous and not the glamorous\nThe hunger mixed with passion, so label me as an amethyst\nBOOYAA!!! I’m the type of nigga who giving it to ya\nDon’t hate the playa, hate the game, cuz I’m about to screw ya\nDo ya … Cuz you dead wrong\nإسحب سيفون و بعده move on\nOh yes we ridin here tonight … And we represent the West Coast that’s for life\nIf you feel what we doing put your hands up in the sky\nJeddah Legends till the day we die …","url":"https://fnanen.com/klmat/alaghany/8/89y/jl-anthem.html?arabic=JL Anthem"}
