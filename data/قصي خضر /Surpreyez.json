{"title":"Surpreyez","date":"2010","lyrics":"Ready or not, Ozone is taking over\nPosition on the front line stand like a soldier\nGot you hanging our map on the wall like a poster\nYour mind is playing tricks on you like a roller coaster\nThere is no competition cuz we’re players of the same team\nBut the hate has blinded you, and that’s far as you can see\nI’m speaking on behalf of my people overseas\nWe have no choice … Why call it democracy?\nFollow the instructions … Don Legend introduction\nConjunction junction … What’s your function?\nTo illustrate as I’m entering your premises\nViolating properties with bunch of hypocrites\nI’m the # 1 contender … The Middle East representer\nFrom spring to fall … From summer to winter\nWhen I enter the center, I’ll be my people’s defender\nA Taurus and a Gemini signs mixed in the blender","url":"https://fnanen.com/klmat/alaghany/8/89y/surpreyez.html?arabic=Surpreyez"}
