{"title":"Calling","lyrics":"I'm looking with my eyes closed...it's not dream\n\nFeelmy energy from head to toes...witness the scene\n\nOf a young man trying to live...searching for love\n\nGod the heart to offer, hands to giv...blessed from above\n\nBut this crooked world won't allow him...lost soul\n\nLife is a gift...but some people just don't know\n\nThat's why they fight just to take charge...and once they do\n\nThey make everything so damn hard...for me and you\n\nThen we say life is a bitch...but it's not\n\nYou're broke and he's so damn rich...when will it stop\n\nIt ain't fair, it ain't easy...but who did it?\n\nA human like me and you...yeah I said it\n\nWhat the different between us...I don't see it\n\nWe are the future and we're ready to provide it and be it\n\nBut I guess times is the answer...and it will heal\n\nTaste the joy of freedom...as we share and feel\n\n\n\n\nAs we go through life...it seems we are falling\n\nCan you hear us Lord...you're children as calling\nNow as I'm opening my eyes I've witnessed pain and suffer\n\nSurrounded by confusions since I lost my grandmother\n\nSince the birth of earth, there was a gift and curse\n\nWhich one came first? Which one really hurts?\n\n \n\n\nاستمع إلى \"Calling\" على أنغامي","url":"https://fnanen.com/klmat/alaghany/8/89y/calling.html?arabic=Calling"}
